# Python-3-game-of-pool
This is a single player game of pool I wrote completely in python 3. Since pool is naturally not a 1 player game, there is a lives counter and a small
tweak to the rules of how the game is played. Simply, try not to pocket the white ball. The goal is to clean the table with out pocketing the white ball 3x.
